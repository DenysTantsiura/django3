The possibility of adding a new author to the site only for registered users.
The possibility of adding a new quote to the site with an indication of the author only for registered users.

You can go to each author's page without user authentication
All quotes are viewable without user authentication

# Additional

Search for quotes by tag. When you click on a tag, a list of quotes with this tag is displayed.
Implement the "Top Ten tags" block and display the most popular tags.
